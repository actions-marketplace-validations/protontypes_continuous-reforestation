This is a template for creating GitHub actions and contains a small Python application which will be built into a minimal [Container Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action). Our final container from this template is ~50MB, yours may be a little bigger once you add some code. If you want something smaller check out my [go-container-action template](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/go-container-action/actions).

In `main.py` you will find a small example of accessing Action inputs and returning Action outputs. For more information on communicating with the workflow see the [development tools for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/development-tools-for-github-actions).

> üèÅ To get started, click the `Use this template` button on this repository [which will create a new repository based on this template](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/).

## Use cases

* Have a scheduled tree-plant (i.e. once per week)
* plant trees on pull requests (and/or push, ...)
* plant trees on linter fails (as self-motivation)
  * or on sucess ;)
* Plant tree for first ever contribution
* on release
* on milestone
* on closed issue (or opened, ...)

See more possible trigger events [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).
